'Squeak by Example

Squeak by Example is a book, intended for both students and developers, that will guide you through the Smalltalk language and the Squeak environment by means of a series of examples and exercises. The book helps you getting started with an initial tour of the environment before introducing the details of the language, the standard library, the tools, and the Morphic framework.

About this version of the book

Squeak by Example is a classical book intended for PDF/print format in the first place. Nevertheless, we made some efforts to make it available right in Squeak. For this, we wrote our own LaTeX parser that uses Sandblocks'' Tree-sitter integration and a LaTeX grammar for tree-sitter to convert over 10,000 SLOC of text into Squeak objects (don''t try this at home!!). You can read the result in this help structure or search it using the search bar at the top. Note that this parser is meant to be an approximation only and we didn''t get every space right to save our own sanity. Nevertheless, if you''ve got any questions or feedback, we''re there at our GitHub repo: https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/SqueakByExample-english

Enjoy and carpe Squeak!!!
