\chapter{Streams}\label{cha:streams}

\clsindexmain{Stream}
Streams are used to iterate over sequences of elements such as sequenced collections, files, and network streams.
With Streams you can represent different iterations on the same collection, speed up the creation of large collections, and even iterate over potentially infinite collections without running into an infinite loop.
A Stream instance represents an iteration for reading, writing, or both.
Reading or writing is always relative to the current position in the stream.

%=============================================================
\section{Two sequences of elements}
A good model to understand a stream is the following:
A stream can be represented as two sequences of elements: a past element sequence and a future element sequence.
The stream is positioned between the two sequences.
Understanding this model is important since all stream operations in Smalltalk rely on it.
For this reason, most of the \clsind{Stream} classes are subclasses of \clsind{PositionableStream}.
\figref{_abcde} presents a stream which contains five characters. This stream is in its original position, \ie there is no element in the past.
You can go back to this position using the message \mthind{PositionableStream}{reset}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{_abcdeStef}}
\caption{A stream positioned at its beginning.}
\label{fig:_abcde}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

You can now read the next element from the stream using the message \mthind{Stream}{next}.
Reading an element conceptually means removing the first element of the future element sequence, returning it, and putting it after the last element in the past element sequence.
After having read one element using the message \ct{next}, the state of your stream is that shown in \figref{a_bcde}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{a_bcdeStef}}
\caption{The same stream after the execution of the method \ct{next}.
The character \ct{a} is ``in the past'' whereas \ct{b}, \ct{c}, \ct{d} and \ct{e} are ``in the future''.}
\label{fig:a_bcde}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

You can write an element to a stream using the message \mthind{Stream}{nextPut:} \ct{anElement}. Writing an element means replacing the first element of the future sequence with the new one and moving it to the past.
\figref{ax_cde} shows the state of the same stream after having written an \ct{x}.

\begin{figure}[h!t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ax_cdeStef}}
\caption{The same stream after having written an \ct{x}.}
\label{fig:ax_cde}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

%=============================================================
\section{Streams vs. collections}

The collection protocol supports the storage, removal, and enumeration of the elements of a collection, but does not allow these operations
to be intermingled.
For example, if the elements of an \clsind{OrderedCollection} are processed by a \mthind{OrderedCollection}{do:} method, it is not
possible to add or remove elements from inside the \ct{do:} block.
Nor does the collection protocol offer ways to iterate over two collections at the same time, choosing which collection goes forward
and which does not.
Procedures like these require that a traversal index or position reference is maintained outside of the collection itself:
This is exactly the role of \clsind{ReadStream}, \clsind{WriteStream}, and \clsind{ReadWriteStream}.

These three classes are defined to \emph{stream over} some collection.
For example, the following snippet creates a stream on an interval, then it reads two elements.
\needlines{5}
\begin{code}{@TEST |r|}
r := ReadStream on: (1 to: 1000).
r next   --> 1
r next   --> 2
r atEnd --> false
\end{code}

\ct{WriteStream}s can write data to the collection:
\begin{code}{@TEST |w|}
w := WriteStream on: (String new: 5).
w nextPut: $a; nextPut: $b.
w contents -->  'ab'
\end{code}

It is also possible to create \ct{ReadWriteStream}s that support both the reading and writing protocols.

Streams are not only meant for collections, they can be used for files or sockets too.
The following example creates a file named \ct{test.txt}, writes two strings to it, separated by a carriage return, and closes the file.
After that, the file contents are read again into the image.

\needlines{3}
\begin{code}{@TEST}
StandardFileStream
  fileNamed: 'someTestFile.txt'
  do: [:stream | stream
        nextPutAll: '123';
        space;
        nextPutAll: 'abcd'].

StandardFileStream readOnlyFileNamed: 'someTestFile.txt' do: [:stream | stream contents] --> '123 abcd'
\end{code}
% ct TODO: Line breaks in the previous example would be nice but would require a redesign of SBEtests.
\cmindex{FileStream class}{fileNamed:do:}

The following sections present the protocols in more depth.

%=============================================================
\section{Streaming over collections}

Streams are really useful when dealing with collections of elements.
They can be used for reading and writing elements in collections.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reading collections}

This section presents features used for reading collections.
Using a stream to read a collection essentially provides you a pointer into the collection.
That pointer will move forward on reading and you can place it wherever you want.
The class \clsindmain{ReadStream} should be used to read elements from collections.

Methods \mthind{ReadStream}{next} and \mthind{ReadStream}{next:} are used to retrieve one or more elements from the collection.

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream|}
stream := ReadStream on: #(1 (a b c) false).
stream next -->   1
stream next -->   #(#a #b #c)
stream next -->   false
\end{code}
\cmindex{PositionableStream class}{on:}

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream|}
stream := ReadStream on: 'abcdef'.
stream next: 0 -->   ''
stream next: 1 -->   'a'
stream next: 3 -->   'bcd'
stream next: 2 -->   'ef'
\end{code}

The message \mthind{PositionableStream}{peek} is used when you want to know what is the next element in the stream without going forward.

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream negative number|}
stream := ReadStream on: '-143'.
negative := stream peek = $-.    "look at the first element without reading it"
negative --> true
negative ifTrue: [stream next].       "ignores the minus character"
number := stream upToEnd.
number --> '143'
\end{code}
\noindent
This code sets the boolean variable \ct{negative} according to the sign of the number in the stream and \ct{number} to its absolute value.
The method \mthind{ReadStream}{upToEnd} returns everything from the current position to the end of the stream and sets the stream to its end.
This code can be simplified using \mthind{PositionableStream}{peekFor:}, which moves forward if the following element equals the parameter and doesn't move otherwise.

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream negative number|}
stream := '-143' readStream.
stream peekFor: $- --> true
stream upToEnd         --> '143'
\end{code}
\noindent
\ct{peekFor:} also returns a boolean indicating if the parameter equals the element.

You might have noticed a new way of constructing a stream in the above example:
One can simply send \mthind{SequenceableCollection}{readStream} to a sequenceable collection to get a reading stream on that particular
collection.

\paragraph{Positioning.}
There are also methods to position the stream pointer directly.
If you have the index, you can go directly to it using \mthind{PositionableStream}{position:}.
You can request the current position using \mthind{PositionableStream}{position}.
Please remember that a stream is not positioned on an element, but between two elements.
The index corresponding to the beginning of the stream is 0.

You can obtain the state of the stream depicted in \figref{ab_cde} with the following code:

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream|}
stream := 'abcde' readStream.
stream position: 2.
stream peek --> $c
\end{code}

\begin{figure}[h!t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ab_cdeStef}}
\caption{A stream at position 2}
\label{fig:ab_cde}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

To position the stream at the beginning or the end,
% If you want to go to the beginning or at the end is what you want,
you can use \mthind{PositionableStream}{reset} or \mthind{PositionableStream}{setToEnd}.
\mthind{PositionableStream}{skip:} and \mthind{PositionableStream}{skipTo:} are used to go forward to a location relative to the current position:
\ct{skip:} accepts a number as argument and skips that number of elements whereas \ct{skipTo:} skips all elements in the stream until it finds an element equal to its parameter.
Note that it positions the stream after the matched element.

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream|}
stream := 'abcdef' readStream.
stream next        --> $a    "stream is now positioned just after the a"
stream skip: 3.                           "stream is now after the d"
stream position  -->   4
stream skip: -2.                          "stream is after the b"
stream position  --> 2
stream reset.
stream position  --> 0
stream skipTo: $e.                      "stream is just after the e now"
stream next        --> $f
stream contents --> 'abcdef'
\end{code}

As you can see, the letter \ct{e} has been skipped. The method \mthind{PositionableStream}{contents} always returns a copy of the entire stream.

\paragraph{Testing.} Some methods allow you to test the state of the current stream:
\mthind{PositionableStream}{atEnd} returns true if and only if no more elements can be read whereas \mthind{PositionableStream}{isEmpty} returns true if and only if there is no element at all in the collection.

Here is a possible implementation of an algorithm using \ct{atEnd} that takes two sorted collections as parameters and merges those collections into another sorted collection:

\needlines{4}
\begin{code}{@TEST |stream1 stream2 result|}
stream1 := #(1 4 9 11 12 13) readStream.
stream2 := #(1 2 3 4 5 10 13 14 15) readStream.

"The variable result will contain the sorted collection."
result := OrderedCollection new.
[stream1 atEnd not and: [stream2 atEnd not]]
	whileTrue: [stream1 peek < stream2 peek
		"Remove the smallest element from either stream and add it to the result."
		ifTrue: [result add: stream1 next]
		ifFalse: [result add: stream2 next]].

"One of the two streams might not be at its end. Copy whatever remains."
result
	addAll: stream1 upToEnd;
	addAll: stream2 upToEnd.

result. -->   an OrderedCollection(1 1 2 3 4 4 5 9 10 11 12 13 13 14 15)
\end{code}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Writing to collections}

We have already seen how to read a collection by iterating over its elements using a \ct{ReadStream}.
We'll now learn how to create collections using \clsindmain{WriteStream}{}s.

\ct{WriteStream}s are useful for appending a lot of data to a collection at various locations.
They are often used to construct strings that are based on static and dynamic parts as in this example:

\begin{code}{NB: can't be tested due to the changing number of classes}
stream := String new writeStream.
stream
	nextPutAll: 'This Smalltalk image contains: ';
	print: Smalltalk allClasses size;
	nextPutAll: ' classes.';
	cr;
	nextPutAll: 'This is really a lot.'.

stream contents. --> 'This Smalltalk image contains: 2814 classes.
This is really a lot.'
\end{code}

This technique is used in the different implementations of the method \ct{printOn:} for example.
There is a simpler and more efficient way of creating streams if you are only interested in the content of the stream:

\begin{code}{@TEST |string|}
string := String streamContents: [:stream |
			stream
                 print: #(1 2 3);
                 space;
                 nextPutAll: 'size';
                 space;
                 nextPut: $=;
                 space;
                 print: 3].
string -->   '#(1 2 3) size = 3'
\end{code}

The method \mthind{SequenceableCollection class}{streamContents:} \label{sec:streamContents} creates a collection and a stream on
that collection for you.
It then executes the block you gave passing the stream as a parameter.
When the block ends, \ct{streamContents:} returns the content of the collection.

The following \ct{WriteStream} methods are especially useful in this context:

\begin{description}
\item[\lct{nextPut:}] adds the parameter to the stream;
\item[\lct{nextPutAll:}] adds each element of the collection, passed as a
  parameter, to the stream;
\item[\lct{print:}] adds the textual representation of the parameter to the
  stream.
	\cmindex{Stream}{print:}
\end{description}

There are also methods useful for printing different kinds of characters to the stream like \mthind{WriteStream}{space}, \mthind{WriteStream}{tab}, and \mthind{WriteStream}{cr} (carriage return).
Another useful method is \mthind{WriteStream}{ensureASpace} which ensures that the last character in the stream is a space; if the last character isn't a space it adds one.

\paragraph{About Concatenation.}
Using \mthind{WriteStream}{nextPut:} and \mthind{WriteStream}{nextPutAll:} on a \ct{WriteStream} is often the best way to concatenate characters.
Using the comma concatenation selector (\mthind{Collection}{,}) is far less efficient:

%Last updated 2020-10-26 pre
\begin{code}{}
[| temp |
  temp := String new.
  (1 to: 100000) do: [:i |
    temp := temp, i asString, ' ']] timeToRun. --> 386381 "(milliseconds)"

[| temp |
  temp := WriteStream on: String new.
  (1 to: 100000) do: [:i |
    temp nextPutAll: i asString; space].
  temp contents] timeToRun. --> 25 "(milliseconds)"
\end{code}

The reason that using a stream can be much more efficient is that the comma creates a new string containing the concatenation of the receiver and the argument, so it must copy both of them.
When you repeatedly concatenate onto the same receiver, it gets longer and longer each time, so that the number of characters that must be copied goes up exponentially.
This also creates a lot of garbage, which must be collected.
Using a stream instead of string concatenation is a well-known optimization.
\lr{About Concatenation. This is not true for real-world examples (the example benchmark is unrealistic). Most of the time concatenation is simpler, cleaner, and much faster, for example when being used on a small number of longer strings. (p. 257)}
In fact, you can use \mthind{SequenceableCollection class}{streamContents:} (mentioned on page \pageref{sec:streamContents}) to help you do this:

\begin{code}{}
String streamContents: [:tempStream |
  (1 to: 100000) do: [:i |
    tempStream nextPutAll: i asString; space]].
\end{code}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reading and writing at the same time}

It's possible to use a stream to access a collection for reading and writing at the same time.
Imagine you want to create a \ct{SBEHistory} class which will manage backward and forward buttons in a web browser.
A history would react as in figures from \ref{fig:emptyStream} to \ref{fig:page4}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{emptyStef}}
\caption{A new history is empty. Nothing is displayed in the web browser.}
\label{fig:emptyStream}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page1Stef}}
\caption{The user opens page 1.}
\label{fig:page1}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page2Stef}}
\caption{The user clicks on a link to page 2.}
\label{fig:page2}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page3Stef}}
\caption{The user clicks on a link to page 3.}
\label{fig:page3}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page2_Stef}}
\caption{The user clicks on the back button. He is now viewing page 2 again.}
\label{fig:page2_}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page1_Stef}}
\caption{The user clicks again the back button. Page 1 is now displayed.}
\label{fig:page1_}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{page4Stef}}
\caption{From page 1, the user clicks on a link to page 4. The history forgets pages 2 and 3.}
\label{fig:page4}
\vspace{.2in}
\end{figure}

This behavior can be implemented using a \clsind{ReadWriteStream}.

\needlines{6}
% todo: would be nice to use numFiletreeMethodInput here again ...
\begin{code}{Class definition of \ct{SBEHistory}.}
Object subclass: #SBEHistory
	instanceVariableNames: 'stream'
	classVariableNames: ''
	poolDictionaries: ''
	category: 'SBE-Streams'
\end{code}

\clearpage

\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistoryinitialize]%
{Initialization of \ct{SBEHistory} instances.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/initialize.st}

Nothing really difficult here, we define a new class which contains a stream.
The stream is created during the \ct{initialize} method.

We need methods to go backward and forward:

\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistorygobackward]%
{Method \ct{goBackward} in \ct{SBEHistory}.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/goBackward.st}
\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistorygoforward]%
{Method \ct{goForward} in \ct{SBEHistory}.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/goForward.st}

Until then, the code was pretty straightforward.
Now, we have to deal with the \ct{goTo:} method which should be activated when the user clicks on a link.
A possible solution is:

\begin{code}{}
SBEHistory>>goTo: aPage

	stream nextPut: aPage.
\end{code}

This version is incomplete however, as when the user clicks on the link, there should be no more future pages to go to, \ie the forward button must be deactivated.
To represent this, the simplest solution is to write \ct{nil} after adding the page to indicate the end of the history:

\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistorygoto]%
{Method \ct{goTo:} in \ct{SBEHistory}.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/goTo..st}

Now, only methods \ct{canGoBackward} and \ct{canGoForward} have to be implemented.

A stream is always positioned between two elements.
To go backward, there must be two pages before the current position:
One page is the current page, and the other one is the page we want to go to.

\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistorycangobackward]%
{Method \ct{canGoBackward} in \ct{SBEHistory}.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/canGoBackward.st}

To go forward, the stream should not be at its end, and the next element should not be \ct{nil}, which we used to represent the end of the history.

\numFiletreeMethodInput[sbehistorycangoforward]%
{Method \ct{canGoForward} in \ct{SBEHistory}.}%
{ListingSources/SBE-Streams.package/SBEHistory.class/instance/canGoForward.st}

Let us add a method to peek at the contents of the stream:
\begin{code}{}
SBEHistory>>contents

	^ stream contents
\end{code}
% ct TODO: Reuse SmalltalkSources here!

And the history works as advertised:
\begin{code}{}
SBEHistory new
	goTo: #page1;
	goTo: #page2;
	goTo: #page3;
	goBackward;
	goBackward;
	goTo: #page4;
	contents. --> #(#page1 #page4 nil nil)
\end{code}

%=============================================================
\section{Using streams for file access}

You have already seen how to stream over collections of elements.
It's also possible to stream over files on your hard disk.
Once created, a stream on a file is really like a stream on a collection:
You will be able to use the same protocol to read, write, or position the stream.
The main difference appears in the creation of the stream.
There are several different ways to create file streams, as we shall now see.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Creating file streams}
\label{sec:creat-file-stre}

To create file streams, you will have to use one of the following instance creation methods offered by the class \clsindmain{FileStream}:

\begin{description}

\item[\lct{fileNamed:}]
  Open a file with the given name for reading and writing.
  If the file already exists, its prior contents may be modified or replaced, but the file will not be truncated on close.
  If the name has no directory part, then the file will be created in the default directory.
	\cmindex{FileStream class}{fileNamed:}

\item[\lct{newFileNamed:}]
  Create a new file with the given name and answer a stream opened for writing on that file.
  If the file already exists, ask the user what to do.
	\cmindex{FileStream class}{newFileNamed:}

\item[\lct{forceNewFileNamed:}]
  Create a new file with the given name and answer a stream opened for writing on that file.
  If the file already exists, delete it without asking before creating the new file.
	\cmindex{FileStream class}{forceNewFileNamed:}

\item[\lct{oldFileNamed:}]
  Open an existing file with the given name for reading and writing.
  If the file already exists, its prior contents may be modified or replaced, but the file will not be truncated on close.
  If the name has no directory part, then the file will be created in the default directory.
	\cmindex{FileStream class}{oldFileNamed:}

\item[\lct{readOnlyFileNamed:}] Open an existing file with the
	given name for reading.
	\cmindex{FileStream class}{readOnlyFileNamed:}

\end{description}

You have to remember that each time you open a stream on a file, you have to close it too.
This is done through the \mthind{FileStream}{close} method.

\begin{code}{@TEST |stream|}
stream := FileStream forceNewFileNamed: 'test.txt'.
stream
    nextPutAll: 'This text is written in a file named ';
    print: stream localName.
stream close.

stream := FileStream readOnlyFileNamed: 'test.txt'.
stream contents. --> 'This text is written in a file named ''test.txt'''
stream close.
\end{code}

% \on{need way to clean up test files afterwards}

%[:fileName | (FileDirectory forFileName: fileName)
%	deleteFileNamed: fileName
%	ifAbsent: [ 'Could not delete ', fileName ] ]
%	value: 'test.txt'

The method \mthind{FileStream}{localName} answers the last component of the name of the file.
You can also access the full pathname using the method \mthind{StandardFileStream}{fullName}.

You will soon notice that manually closing the file stream is painful and error-prone.
That's why \ct{FileStream} offers varieties of the above messages, that take care of opening and closing the \ct{FileStream} before and after you work with it.
You pass the code that works with the stream as a block to these methods, \eg the second argument of \mthind{FileStream class}{forceNewFileNamed:do:}.

\begin{code}{@TEST |string|}
FileStream
    forceNewFileNamed: 'test.txt'
    do: [:stream |
        stream
            nextPutAll: 'This text is written in a file named ';
            print: stream localName].
string := FileStream
            readOnlyFileNamed: 'test.txt'
            do: [:stream | stream contents].
string --> 'This text is written in a file named ''test.txt'''
\end{code}

The stream-creation methods that take a block as an argument first create a stream on a file, then execute the block with the stream
as an argument, and finally, close the stream.
These methods return what is returned by the block, which is to say, the value of the last expression in the block.
This is used in the previous example to get the content of the file and put it in the variable \ct{string}.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Binary streams}
\label{sec:binary-streams}

By default, file streams are text-based which means you will read and write characters.
If your stream must be binary, you have to send the message \mthind{FileStream}{binary} to your stream.

When your stream is in binary mode, you can only write numbers from 0 to 255 (1 Byte).
If you want to use \ct{nextPutAll:} to write more than one number at a time, you have to pass a \clsind{ByteArray} as an argument.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
FileStream
  forceNewFileNamed: 'test.bin'
  do: [:stream |
          stream
            binary;
            nextPutAll: #[145 250 139 98]].

FileStream
  readOnlyFileNamed: 'test.bin'
  do: [:stream |
          stream binary.
          stream size.         --> 4
          stream next.         --> 145
          stream upToEnd --> #[250 139 98]
   		].
\end{code}

Here is another example which creates a picture in a file named ``test.pgm'' (portable graymap file format).
You can open this file with your favorite drawing program.
If you do not have a relevant program, you can also drag the file into your \sq image to watch it.

\section{Chapter summary}

Streams offer a better way than collections to incrementally read and write a sequence of elements.
There are easy ways to convert back and forth between streams and collections.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Streams may be either readable, writeable, or both readable and writeable.
	\item To get a stream for a collection, create a stream ``on'' a collection, \eg \ct{ReadStream on: (1 to: 1000)}, or send the messages \ct{readStream} \etc to the collection.
	\item To get the collection of a stream, send the message \ct{contents}.
	\item To concatenate large collections, instead of using the comma operator, it is more efficient to create a stream, append the collections to the stream with \ct{nextPutAll:}, and extract the result by sending \ct{contents}.
  \item File streams are by default character-based.
  Send \ct{binary} to explicitly make them binary.
\end{itemize}
