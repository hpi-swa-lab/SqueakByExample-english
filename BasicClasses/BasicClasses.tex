\chapter{Basic Classes}
\label{cha:basic}

Most of the power of Smalltalk is not in the language but the class libraries.
To program effectively with Smalltalk, you need to learn how the class libraries support the language and environment.
The class libraries are entirely written in Smalltalk and we can easily extend them since a package may add new functionality to a class even if it does not define this class.

Our goal here is not to present in tedious detail the whole of the Squeak class library, but rather to point out the key classes and methods that you will need to use or override to program effectively.
In this chapter we cover the basic classes that you will need for nearly every application: \ct{Object}, \ct{Number} and its subclasses, \ct{Character}, \ct{String}, \ct{Symbol}, \ct{Boolean}, and \ct{Exception}.
In the following chapter \charef{collections}, we will discuss the equally important \ct{Collection} subclasses.

\md{Here are some comments:\\
- Debugging: Yes, needs its own chapter. We should talk about haltIf, haltOnce...\\
- Characters and Strings: we should talk about Unicode stuff... but I don't know too much myself.}

%=================================================================
\section{Object}
\clsindmain{Object} is the root of the inheritance hierarchy.
Actually, in Squeak the true root of the hierarchy is \clsind{ProtoObject}, which is used to define minimal entities that masquerade as objects, but we can ignore this point for the time being.

\ct{Object} can be found in the \scatind{Kernel-Objects} category.
Astonishingly, there are almost 500 methods to be found here (including extensions).
In other words, every class that you define will automatically provide these methods, whether you know what they do or not.

\sd{I do not like to quote something that can change and that people can find simply in the image but let us keep it for now.}
The class comment for the \ct{Object} states:

\needlines{4}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \ct{Object} is the root class for almost all of the other classes in the class hierarchy.
    The exceptions are \ct{ProtoObject} (the superclass of \ct{Object}) and its subclasses.

    Class \ct{Object} provides default behavior common to all normal objects, such as access, copying, comparison, error handling, message sending, and \ind{reflection}.
    Also, utility messages that all objects should respond to are defined here.

    \ct{Object} has no instance variables, nor should any be added.
    This is due to several classes of objects that inherit from \ct{Object} that have special implementations (\ct{SmallInteger} and \ct{UndefinedObject} for example) or the VM knows about and depends on the structure and layout of certain standard classes.
\end{quote}

If we begin to browse the protocols on the instance side of \ct{Object} we start to see some of the key behavior it provides.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Printing}
Every object in Smalltalk can return a printed form of itself.
You can select any expression in a workspace and select the \menu{print it} menu item:
This executes the expression and asks the returned object to print itself.
In fact, this sends the message \ct{printString} to the returned object.
The method \mthind{Object}{printString}, which is a \ind{template method}, at its core sends the message \mthind{Object}{printOn:} to its receiver.
The message \ct{printOn:} is a hook that can be specialized.

\ct{Object>>>printOn:} is very likely one of the methods that you will most frequently override.
This method takes as its argument a \clsind{Stream} (for more on streams see \charef{streams}) on which a \clsind{String} representation of the object will be written.
The default implementation simply writes the class name preceded by ``\ct{a}'' or ``\ct{an}''.
\ct{Object>>>printString} returns the \ct{String} that is written.

For example, the class \clsind{Browser} does not redefine the method \ct{printOn:} and sending the message \ct{printString} to a \ct{Browser} instance executes the method defined in \ct{Object}.
\begin{code}{@TEST}
Browser new printString --> 'a Browser'
\end{code}

In contrast, the class \ct{PackageInfo} shows an example of \mthind{PackageInfo}{printOn:} specialization.
In addition to the usual name of the class, it prints the name of the package as shown by the code below which prints an instance of the class.

\needlines{7}
\begin{method}[zork]{printOn: redefinition.}
PackagInfo>>>printOn: aStream
	super printOn: aStream.
	aStream
		nextPut: $(;
		nextPutAll: self packageName;
		nextPut: $)
\end{method}

\begin{code}{@TEST}
Object packageInfo printString --> 'a PackageInfo(Kernel)'
\end{code}

Note that the message \ct{printOn:} is not the same as \mthind{Object}{storeOn:}.
The message \ct{storeOn:} puts an expression that can be used to recreate the receiver on its argument stream .
This expression is evaluated when the stream is read using the message \ct{readFrom:}.
\ct{printOn:} just returns a textual version of the receiver that may or may not be a self-evaluating expression.

\paragraph{A word about representation and self-evaluation.}
In functional programming, expressions return values when executed.
In Smalltalk, messages (expressions) return objects (values).
Some objects have the nice properties that their value is themselves.
For example, the value of the object \ct{true} is itself \ie the object \ct{true}.
We call such objects \emphind{self-evaluating objects}.
You can see a \emph{printed} version of an object value when you print the object in a workspace.
Here are some examples of such self-evaluating expressions.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
true       --> true
3 @ 4     --> 3@4
$a         --> $a
#(1 2 3) --> #(1 2 3)
\end{code}

Note that some objects, such as arrays, are self-evaluating or not depending on the objects they contain.
For example, an array of booleans is self-evaluating whereas an array of persons is not.
The following example shows that a \subind{Array}{dynamic} array is self-evaluating only if its elements are:
\begin{code}{@TEST}
{10 @ 10 . 100 @ 100}          --> {10@10 . 100@100}
{Browser new . 100 @ 100} --> {a Browser . 100@100}
\end{code}

Remember that \subind{Array}{literal} arrays can only contain literals.
Hence the following array does not contain two points but rather six literal elements.
\begin{code}{@TEST}
#(10 @ 10 100 @ 100) --> #(10 #@ 10 100 #@ 100)
\end{code}

Lots of \ct{printOn:} method specializations implement self-evaluating behavior.
The implementations of \cmind{Point}{printOn:} and \cmind{Interval}{printOn:} are self-evaluating.

\begin{method}[Self-evaluating points]{\ct{Point} print string definition that enables self-evaluation.}
Point>>>printOn: aStream
    "The receiver prints on aStream in terms of infix notation."

    x printOn: aStream.
    aStream nextPut: $@.
	...
    y printOn: aStream.
\end{method}

\begin{method}[Self-evaluating intervals]{\ct{Interval} print string definition that enables self-evaluation.}
Interval>>>printOn: aStream

    aStream nextPut: $(;
        print: start;
        nextPutAll: ' to: ';
        print: stop.
    step ~= 1 ifTrue: [aStream nextPutAll: ' by: '; print: step].
    aStream nextPut: $).
\end{method}

\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 to: 10 --> (1 to: 10)    "intervals are self-evaluating"
\end{code}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Identity and equality}

In Smalltalk, the message \ct{=} tests object \emphsubindmain{Object}{equality} (\ie whether two objects represent the same value) whereas \ct{==} tests object \emphsubindmain{Object}{identity} (\ie whether two expressions represent the same object).
\seeindex{\ct{=}}{Object, equality}
\seeindex{\ct{==}}{Object, identity}
\seeindex{equality}{Object, equality}
\seeindex{identity}{Object, identity}

The default implementation of object equality is to test for object identity:
\begin{method}{Object equality.}
Object>>>= anObject
    "Answer whether the receiver and the argument represent the same object.
    If = is redefined in any subclass, consider also redefining the message hash."

    ^ self == anObject
\end{method}
\cmindex{Object}{=}

This is a method that you will frequently want to override.
Consider the case of \ct{Complex} numbers:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
(1 + 2 i) = (1 + 2 i)   --> true     "same value"
(1 + 2 i) == (1 + 2 i) --> false    "but different objects"
\end{code}

This works because \ct{Complex} overrides \ct{=} as follows:
\cmindex{Complex}{=}
\needlines{5}
\begin{method}{Equality for complex numbers.}
Complex>>>= anObject

	anObject isNumber ifFalse: [^ false].
	anObject isComplex
		ifTrue: [^ real = anObject real and: [imaginary = anObject imaginary]]
		ifFalse: [^ anObject adaptToComplex: self andSend: #=]
\end{method}

The default implementation of \ct{Object>>>~=} simply negates \ct{Object>>>=}, and should not normally need to be changed.
%\cmindex{Object}{\~=}
\index{Object!~=@\ct{~=}} % needs special treatment due to ~

\begin{code}{@TEST}
(1 + 2 i) ~= (1 + 4 i) --> true
\end{code}

\important{If you override \ct{=}, you should override \mthind{Object}{hash}.}

If instances of your class are ever used as keys in a \clsind{Dictionary}, then you should make sure that instances that are considered to be equal have the same hash value. This is because the implementation of \clsind{Dictionary} will only use the \ct{hash} to determine whether it includes an object as a key:
\cmindex{Complex}{hash}
\begin{method}{Hash must be reimplemented for complex numbers.}
Complex>>>hash
    "Hash is reimplemented because = is implemented."

    ^ real hash bitXor: imaginary hash
\end{method}

Although you should override \ct{=} and \ct{hash} together, you should \emph{never} override \ct{==}.
(The semantics of object identity is the same for all classes.)
\ct{==} is a primitive method of \clsind{ProtoObject}.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Class membership}
Several methods allow you to query the class of an object.

\paragraph{\mthind{Object}{class}.}
You can ask any object about its class using the message \ct{class}.
\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 class --> SmallInteger
\end{code}

Conversely, you can ask if an object is an instance of a specific class:
\cmindex{Object}{isMemberOf:}
\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 isMemberOf: SmallInteger --> true    "must be precisely this class"
1 isMemberOf: Integer          --> false
1 isMemberOf: Number        --> false
1 isMemberOf: Object           --> false
\end{code}

Since Smalltalk is written in itself, you can really navigate through its structure using the right combination of superclass and class messages (see \charef{metaclasses}).

\paragraph{\ct{isKindOf:}.}
\cmind{Object}{isKindOf:} answers whether the receiver's class is either the same as, or a subclass of the argument class.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 isKindOf: SmallInteger --> true
1 isKindOf: Integer          --> true
1 isKindOf: Number         --> true
1 isKindOf: Object           --> true
1 isKindOf: String            --> false

1 / 3 isKindOf: Number      --> true
1 / 3 isKindOf: Integer        --> false
\end{code}

\ct{1 / 3} which is a \clsind{Fraction} is a kind of \clsind{Number}, since the class \ct{Number} is a superclass of the class \ct{Fraction}, but \ct{1 / 3} is not a \ct{Integer}.

\paragraph{\ct{respondsTo:}.}
\cmind{Object}{respondsTo:} answers whether the receiver understands the message selector given as an argument.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 respondsTo: #, --> false
\end{code}

Normally, it is a \emph{bad idea} to query an object for its class, or to ask it which messages it understands.
Instead of making decisions based on the class of object, you should simply send a message to the object and let it decide (\ie based on its class) how it should behave.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Copying}

There are several ways to copy objects in \sq, depending on what you want to copy. For example, when you copy a collection, you might want to or might not want to copy all its elements. If you are not sure what the right way to copy an object is, the first message to send is \ct{copy}, as it takes care of copying the right instance variables for you.

To understand the other messages for copying, we will discuss different ways at looking at copying one after another.
In general, copying objects introduces some subtle issues.
Since instance variables are accessed by reference, a \emphsubind{Object}{shallow copy} of an object would share its references to instance variables with the original object:
\seeindex{copy}{Object, \ct{copy}}
\seeindex{shallow copy}{Object, \ct{shallowCopy}}
\seeindex{deep copy}{Object, \ct{deepCopy}}

% The spaces are deliberate in the listing below, to emphasize the nested arrays --pre
\begin{code}{@TEST | array1 array2 |}
array1 := { { 'harry' } }.
array1 --> #(#('harry'))
array2 := array1 shallowCopy.
array2 --> #(#('harry'))
(array1 at: 1) at: 1 put: 'sally'.
array1 --> #(#('sally'))
array2 --> #(#('sally'))    "the subarray is shared!"
\end{code}

\cmind{Object}{shallowCopy} creates a shallow copy of an object, which means that the content of the object is not copied.
Since \ct{a2} is only a shallow copy of \ct{a1}, the two arrays share a reference to the nested \ct{Array} that they contain.

For some classes even a shallow copy does not make sense if instances are unique, for example for the classes \clsind{Boolean}, \clsind{Character}, \clsind{SmallInteger}, \clsind{Symbol} and \clsind{UndefinedObject}. These classes override \cmind{Object}{shallowCopy} and instances simply return themselves.

\cmind{Object}{copyTwoLevel} can be used when a simple shallow copy does not suffice. It copies the object and its contents, but not deeper.

\begin{code}{@TEST | array1 array2 |}
array1 := { { 'harry' } }.
array2 := array1 copyTwoLevel.
(array1 at: 1) at: 1 put: 'sally'.
array1 --> #(#('sally'))
array2 --> #(#('harry'))    "fully independent state"
\end{code}

\cmind{Object}{deepCopy} makes an arbitrarily deep copy of an object.

\begin{code}{@TEST | array1 array2 |}
array1 := { { { 'harry' } } }.
array2 := array1 deepCopy.
(array1 at: 1) at: 1 put: 'sally'.
array1 --> #(#('sally'))
array2 --> #(#(#('harry')))
\end{code}

However, \ct{deepCopy} does not keep track of previously copied objects. This means that it does not preserve the identity of re-occurring objects. When the object to be copied contains another object twice in its contents, there will be two new objects.

\needlines{5}
\begin{code}{@TEST | object array copiedArray |}
object := {'harry'}.
array := {object . object}.
array first == array second --> true
copiedArray := array deepCopy.
copiedArray first == copiedArray second --> false
\end{code}

Also, not keeping track of previously copied objects means that \ct{deepCopy} will not terminate when applied to a mutually recursive structure.

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
array1 := {'harry'}.
array2 := {array1}.
array1 at: 1 put: array2.
array1 deepCopy --> !\emph{... does not terminate!}!
\end{code}

Another way to copy an object is provided by \cmind{Object}{veryDeepCopy}:
It creates arbitrarily deep copies of objects but preserves object identities and cycles.

\begin{code}{@TEST | array1 array2 copiedArray |}
array1 := {'harry'}.
array2 := {array1}.
array1 at: 1 put: array2.
copiedArray := array1 veryDeepCopy.
copiedArray first first = copiedArray --> true
\end{code}

Whether any of these four copy methods is the right one depends on the meaning of the object and its instance variables.
As this can not be decided in general for all objects and all use cases, \cmind{Object}{copy} delegates this decision to specific subclasses.
\cmind{Object}{copy} first creates a shallow copy, and then asks this shallow copy to copy any instance variables that should be copied by sending \ct{postCopy} to it.

\needlines{5}
\begin{method}{Copying objects as a template method.}
Object>>>copy
    "Answer another instance just like the receiver. Subclasses typically override postCopy; they typically do not override shallowCopy."

    ^ self shallowCopy postCopy
\end{method}

You should override \mthind{Object}{postCopy} to copy any instance variables that should not be shared.
\ct{postCopy} should always do a \ct{super postCopy}.
For example, a \clsind{Form} object has instance variables for width, height, bit depth, an offset, and the actual bits.
As the first four instance variables are all described by numbers, there is no need to copy them as you can see in \mthind{Form}{postCopy}.

\needlines{4}
\begin{method}{Copying objects as a template method.}
Form>>>postCopy

	super postCopy.
    bits := bits copy.
\end{method}



%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Debugging}

The most important method here is \mthind{Object}{halt}.
In order to set a breakpoint in a method, simply insert the message send \ct{self halt} at some point in the body of the method.
When this message is sent, execution will be interrupted and a \ind{debugger} will open to this point in your program.
(See \charef{env} for more details about the debugger.)

\sd{in another chapter haltIf:, haltOnce, inspectOnce, flagging: isThisEverCalled, }

The next most important message is \mthind{Object}{assert:}, which takes a \ind{block} as its argument.
If the block returns \ct{true}, execution continues.
Otherwise, an \ct{AssertionFailure} exception will be raised, which is a subclass of \ct{Error}.
If this exception is not otherwise caught, the debugger will open to this point in the execution.
\ct{assert:} is especially useful to support \emphind{design by contract}.
The most typical usage is to check non-trivial pre-conditions to public methods of objects.
\cmind{Stack}{pop} could easily have been implemented as follows:

\begin{method}{Checking a pre-condition.}
Stack>>>pop
    "Return the first element and remove it from the stack."

    self assert: [self isEmpty not].
    ^ self linkedList removeFirst element
\end{method}

Do not confuse \ct{Object>>>assert:} with \cmind{TestCase}{assert:}, which occurs in the SUnit testing framework (see \charef{SUnit}).
While the former expects a block as its argument\footnote{Actually, it will take any argument that understands \ct{value}, including a \ct{Boolean}.}, the latter expects a \clsind{Boolean}.
Although both are useful for debugging, they each serve a very different intent.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Error handling}

This protocol contains several methods useful for signaling run-time errors.

Sending \lct{self deprecated: \emph{anExplanationString}} signals that the current method should no longer be used, if deprecation has been turned on in the \protind{debug} protocol of the \ind{preference browser}.
The \ct{String} argument should offer an alternative.
\cmindex{Object}{deprecated:}
\index{deprecation}

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
Object new exploreAndYourself --> "Object>>#exploreAndYourself has been deprecated. Use #explore because it does not return the tool window anymore. Only calls via ToolSet do so."
\end{code}

\ct{doesNotUnderstand:} is sent whenever a message lookup fails.
The default implementation, \ie \cmind{Object}{doesNotUnderstand:} will trigger the debugger at this point.
It may be useful to override \lct{does\-Not\-Un\-der\-stand:} to provide some other behavior.

\on{Add a chapter ref when we write the chapter on exceptions.}

\cmind{Object}{error} and \cmind{Object}{error:} are generic methods that can be used to raise exceptions.
(Generally, it is better to raise your own custom exceptions, so you can distinguish errors arising from your code from those coming from kernel classes.)

Abstract methods in Smalltalk are implemented by convention with the body \lct{self sub\-class\-Res\-pon\-si\-bi\-li\-ty}.
Should an abstract class be instantiated by accident, then calls to abstract methods will result in \cmind{Object}{subclassResponsibility} being evaluated.

\begin{method}{Signaling that a method is abstract.}
Object>>>subclassResponsibility
    "This message sets up a framework for the behavior of the class' subclasses.
    Announce that the subclass should have implemented this message."

    ^ SubclassResponsibility
        signal: ('My {1} subclass should have overridden {2}'
            format: {self className. thisContext sender selector})
\end{method}

\clsind{Magnitude}, \clsind{Number} and \clsind{Boolean} are classical examples of \subind{class}{abstract} classes that we shall see shortly in this chapter.

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
Number new + 1 --> !\emph{Error: My subclass should have overridden \#+}!
\end{code}

\ct{self shouldNotImplement} is sent by convention to signal that an inherited method is not appropriate for this subclass.
This is generally a sign that something is not quite right with the design of the class hierarchy.
Due to the limitations of single inheritance, however, sometimes it is very hard to avoid such workarounds.
\cmindex{Object}{shouldNotImplement}
\index{inheritance!canceling}
A typical example is \cmind{Collection}{remove:} which is inherited by \clsind{Dictionary} but flagged as not implemented.
(A \ct{Dictionary} provides \mthind{Dictionary}{removeKey:} instead.)


%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Testing}

The methods in \protind{testing} are not related to unit tests!
A testing method lets you ask a question about the state of the receiver and returns a \clsind{Boolean}.

Numerous testing methods are provided by \ct{Object}.
We have already seen \mthind{Object}{isComplex}.
Others include \mthind{Object}{isArray}, \mthind{Object}{isBoolean}, \mthind{Object}{isBlock}, \mthind{Object}{isCollection}, and so on.
Generally, such methods are to be avoided since querying an object for its class is a form of violation of encapsulation.
Instead of testing an object for its class, one should simply send a request and let the object decide how to handle it.

Nevertheless, some of these testing methods are undeniably useful.
The most useful are probably \cmind{ProtoObject}{isNil} and \cmind{Object}{notNil} (though the \patind{Null Object}\cite{Wool98a} design pattern can obviate the need for even these methods).

% \footnote{However the \emph{Null Object} design pattern can obviate the need for even these methods. See, Bobby Woolf, ``Null Object,'' Pattern Languages of Program Design 3, Robert Martin, Dirk Riehle and Frank Buschmann (Eds.), pp. 5-18, Addison Wesley, 1998.}.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Initialize-release}

A final key method that occurs not in \ct{Object} but in \ct{ProtoObject} is \mthind{ProtoObject}{initialize}.

\begin{method}{\lct{initialize} as an empty hook method.}
ProtoObject>>>initialize
    "Subclasses should redefine this method to perform initializations on instance creation"
\end{method}

The reason this is important is that in Squeak, the default \mthind{Behavior}{new} method defined for every class in the system will send \ct{initialize} to newly created instances.

\begin{method}{\lct{new} as a class-side template method.}
Behavior>>>new
    "Answer a new initialized instance of the receiver (which is a class) with no indexable variables. Fail if the class is indexable."

    ^ self basicNew initialize
\end{method}
\cmindex{Behavior}{new}

This means that simply by overriding the \ct{initialize} \ind{hook method}, new instances of your class will automatically be initialized.
The \ct{initialize} method should normally perform a \ct{super initialize} to establish the class \subind{class}{invariant} for any inherited instance variables.
(Note that this is \emph{not} the standard behavior of other Smalltalks.)

%=================================================================
\section{Numbers}
\label{sec:Number}
Remarkably, numbers in Smalltalk are not primitive data values but true objects.
Of course, numbers are implemented efficiently in the virtual machine, but the \clsindmain{Number} hierarchy is as perfectly accessible and extensible as any other portion of the Smalltalk class hierarchy.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline {\includegraphics[width=8cm]{NumberHierarchy}}
\caption{The Number Hierarchy \label{fig:numbers}.}
\end{figure}

Numbers are found in the \scatind{Kernel-Numbers} category.
The abstract root of this hierarchy is \clsind{Magnitude}, which represents all kinds of classes supporting comparison operators.
\ct{Number} adds various arithmetic and other operators as mostly abstract methods. \clsind{Float} and \clsind{Fraction} represent, respectively, floating-point numbers and fractional values.
\clsind{Integer} is also abstract, thus distinguishing between subclasses \clsind{SmallInteger}, \clsind{LargePositiveInteger} and \clsind{LargeNegativeInteger}.
For the most part, users do not need to be aware of the difference between the three \ct{Integer} classes, as values are automatically converted as needed.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Magnitude}

\clsindmain{Magnitude} is the parent not only of the \clsind{Number} classes, but also of other classes supporting comparison operations, such as \clsind{Character}, \clsind{Duration} and \clsind{Timespan}.
(\clsind{Complex} numbers are not comparable, and so do not inherit from \clsind{Number}.)

Methods \mthind{Magnitude}{<} and \mthind{Magnitude}{=} are abstract.
The remaining operators are defined generically.
For example:

\needlines{10}
\begin{method}{Abstract comparison methods.}
Magnitude>>> < aMagnitude
    "Answer whether the receiver is less than the argument."

    ^ self subclassResponsibility


Magnitude>>> > aMagnitude
    "Answer whether the receiver is greater than the argument."

    ^ aMagnitude < self
\end{method}
\cmindex{Magnitude}{>}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Number}

Similarly, \clsindmain{Number} defines \mthind{Number}{+}, \mthind{Number}{-}, \mthind{Number}{*}, and \mthind{Number}{/} to be abstract, but all other arithmetic operators are generically defined.

All \ct{Number} objects support various \emph{converting} operators, such as \mthind{Number}{asFloat} and \mthind{Number}{asInteger}.
There are also numerous \emphind{shortcut constructor methods}, such as \mthind{Number}{i}, which converts a \ct{Number} to an instance of \clsind{Complex} with a zero real component, and others which generate \clsindplural{Duration}, such as \mthind{Number}{hour}, \mthind{Number}{day} and \mthind{Number}{week}.

\ct{Numbers} directly support common \emph{math functions} such as \mthind{Number}{sin}, \mthind{Number}{log}, \mthind{Number}{raiseTo:}, \mthind{Number}{squared}, \mthind{Number}{sqrt}, and so on.

\cmind{Number}{printOn:} is implemented in terms of the abstract method \ct{Number>>>printOn:base:}.
(The default base is 10.)

Testing methods include \mthind{Number}{even}, \mthind{Number}{odd}, \mthind{Number}{positive}, and \mthind{Number}{negative}.
Unsurprisingly, \ct{Number} overrides \lct{is\-Num\-ber}.
More interesting, \mthind{Number}{isInfinite} is defined to return \ct{false}.

\emph{Truncation} methods include \mthind{Number}{floor}, \mthind{Number}{ceiling}, \mthind{Number}{integerPart}, \mthind{Number}{fractionPart}, and so on.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
1 + 2.5     --> 3.5             "Addition of two numbers"
10 - 8.5   --> 1.5              "Subtraction of two numbers"
3.4 * 5      --> 17.0           "Multiplication of two numbers"
8 / 2         --> 4                 "Division of two numbers"
2 ** 3         --> 8                 "Exponentiation of a number"
12 = 11    --> false           "Equality between two numbers"
12 ~= 11 --> true            "Test if two numbers are different"
12 > 9      --> true            "Greater than"
12 >= 10  --> true            "Greater or equal  than"
12 < 10    --> false           "Smaller than"
100 @ 10   --> 100@10    "Point creation"
\end{code}

The following example works very well in \st:
\begin{code}{@TEST}
1000 factorial / 999 factorial --> 1000
\end{code}
Note that \ct{1000 factorial} is really calculated which in many other languages can be quite difficult to compute.
This is an excellent example of automatic coercion and exact handling of a number.
\cmindex{Integer}{factorial}

\dothis{Try to display the result of \ct{1000 factorial}.
    It takes more time to display it than to calculate it!}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Float}

\clsindmain{Float} implements the abstract \ct{Number} methods for floating point numbers.

More interestingly, \ct{Float class} (\ie the class-side of \ct{Float}) provides methods to return the following \emph{constants}: \mthind{Float class}{e}, \mthind{Float class}{infinity}, \mthind{Float class}{nan}, and \mthind{Float class}{pi}.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
Float pi                      --> 3.141592653589793
Float infinity               --> Infinity
Float infinity isInfinite --> true
\end{code}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Fraction}

\clsind{Fraction}s are represented by instance variables for the numerator and denominator, which should be \ct{Integer}s.
\ct{Fraction}s are normally created by \ct{Integer} division (rather than using the constructor method \cmind{Fraction}{numerator:denominator:}):

\begin{code}{@TEST}
6 / 8             --> (3/4)
(6 / 8) class --> Fraction
\end{code}

Multiplying a \ct{Fraction} by an \ct{Integer} or another \ct{Fraction} may yield an \ct{Integer}:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
6 / 8 * 4 --> 3
\end{code}

\lr{Maybe mention to avoid fractions in results that one of the operands has to be a float, e.g. 6.0 / 8 or 6 asFloat / 8. (p. 213)}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Integer}

\clsindmain{Integer} is the abstract parent of three concrete integer implementations.
In addition to providing concrete implementations of many abstract \ct{Number} methods, it also adds a few methods specific to integers, such as \mthind{Integer}{factorial}, \mthind{Integer}{atRandom}, \mthind{Integer}{isPrime}, \mthind{Integer}{gcd:}, and many others.

\clsindmain{SmallInteger} is special in that its instances are represented compactly --- instead of being stored as a reference, a \ct{SmallInteger} is represented directly using the bits that would otherwise be used to hold a reference.
The first bit of an object reference indicates whether the object is a \ct{SmallInteger} or not.

The class methods \mthind{SmallInteger}{minVal} and \mthind{SmallInteger}{maxVal} tell us the range of a \ct{SmallInteger}, which depends on the bit-width of your processor.

When a \ct{SmallInteger} goes out of this range, it is automatically converted to a \clsind{LargePositiveInteger} or a \clsind{LargeNegativeInteger}, as needed:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
(SmallInteger maxVal + 1) class --> LargePositiveInteger
(SmallInteger minVal - 1) class  --> LargeNegativeInteger
\end{code}

Large integers are similarly converted back to small integers when appropriate.

As in most programming languages, integers can be useful for specifying iterative behavior.
There is a dedicated method \mthind{Integer}{timesRepeat:} for evaluating a block repeatedly.
We have already seen a similar example in \charef{syntax}:
\begin{code}{@TEST | n |}
n := 2.
3 timesRepeat: [n := n * n].
n --> 256
\end{code}

%=================================================================
\section{Characters}

\clsindmain{Character} is defined in the \scatind{Collections-Strings} category as a subclass of \clsind{Magnitude}.
Printable characters are represented in Squeak as \lct{\$$\langle$\emph{char}$\rangle$}.
For example:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
$a < $b --> true
\end{code}

Non-printing characters can be generated by various class methods.
\mbox{\cmind{Character class}{value:}} takes the Unicode (or ASCII) integer value as argument and returns the corresponding character.
The protocol \protind{accessing untypeable characters} contains a number of convenience constructor methods such as \mthind{Character class}{backspace}, \mthind{Character class}{cr}, \mthind{Character class}{escape}, \mthind{Character class}{euro}, \mthind{Character class}{space}, \mthind{Character class}{tab}, and so on.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
Character space = (Character value: Character space asciiValue) --> true
\end{code}

The \mthind{Character}{printOn:} method is clever enough to know which of the three ways to generate characters offers the most appropriate representation:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
Character value: 1  --> Character home
Character value: 32 --> Character space
Character value: 97 --> $a
\end{code}

Various convenient \emph{testing} methods are built in: \mthind{Character}{isAlphaNumeric}, \mthind{Character}{isCharacter}, \mthind{Character}{isDigit}, \mthind{Character}{isLowercase}, \mthind{Character}{isVowel}, and so on.

To convert a \ct{Character} to the string containing just that character, send \mthind{Character}{asString}.
In this case \ct{asString} and \mthind{Character}{printString} yield different results:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
$a asString    --> 'a'
$a                  --> $a
$a printString --> '$a'
\end{code}

Every \ct{Character} is an immediate object, meaning that they are managed by the VM via special pointers. As a consequence, characters are unique, immutable instances.

%=================================================================
\section{Strings}

The \clsindmain{String} class is also defined in the category \scatind{Collections-Strings}.
A \ct{String} is an indexed \ct{Collection} that holds only \ct{Characters}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\ifluluelse
	{\centerline {\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{StringHierarchy}}}
	{\centerline {\includegraphics[width=6cm]{StringHierarchy}}}
\caption{The String Hierarchy.\label{fig:strings}}
\end{figure}

In fact, \ct{String} is abstract, and Squeak \ct{Strings} are usually instances of the concrete class \clsindmain{ByteString}, or \clsindmain{WideString} if they contain any special character that cannot be represented by a single byte. The distinction between the two does not concern you most of the time, as the two classes convert their instances between each other automatically.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
'hello world' class --> ByteString
(String value: 16r1F388) class --> WideString
\end{code}

The other important subclass of \ct{String} is \clsindmain{Symbol}.
The key difference is that there is only ever a single instance of \ct{Symbol} with a given value.
(This is sometimes called ``the unique instance property'').
In contrast, two separately constructed \ct{String}s that happen to contain the same sequence of characters will often be different objects.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
'hel','lo' == 'hello' --> false
\end{code}

\begin{code}{@TEST}
('hel','lo') asSymbol == #hello --> true
\end{code}

\noindent
Another important difference is that a \ct{String} is mutable, whereas a \ct{Symbol} is immutable.
Still, strings that are part of a method need to be copied before altering them because they are constants:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
'hello' copy at: 2 put: $u; yourself --> 'hullo'
\end{code}

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
#hello at: 2 put: $u --> !\emph{error!}!
\end{code}

It is easy to forget that since strings are collections, but they understand the same messages that other collections do:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
#hello indexOf: $o --> 5
\end{code}

Although \ct{String} does not inherit from \clsind{Magnitude}, it does support the usual \protind{comparing} methods, \ct{<}, \ct{=}, and so on.
In addition, \cmind{String}{match:} is useful for some basic glob-style pattern-matching:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
'*or*' match: 'zorro' --> true
\end{code}

Should you need more advanced support for regular expressions, you can also use the \ct{Regex} extension methods defined on \ct{String} from the \ct{Regex-Core} package that was originally developed by Vassili Bykov's.
\index{Bykov, Vassili}
\index{regular expressions}
For example:

\begin{code}{@TEST}
'zorro' matchesRegex: 'z[or]{4}' --> true
'foo, bar, baz' copyWithRegex: '\w+' matchesTranslatedUsing: [:match | match capitalized] --> 'Foo, Bar, Baz'
\end{code}

Strings support rather a large number of conversion methods.
Many of these are \ind{shortcut constructor methods} for other classes, such as \mthind{String}{asDate}, \mthind{String}{asFileName}, and so on.
There are also a number of useful methods for converting a string to another string, such as \mthind{String}{capitalized} and \mthind{String}{translateToLowercase}.

For more on strings and collections, see \charef{collections}.

%=================================================================
\section{Booleans}

The class \clsindmain{Boolean} offers a fascinating insight into how much of the Smalltalk language has been pushed into the class library.
\ct{Boolean} is the \subind{class}{abstract} superclass of the \patind{Singleton} classes \clsindmain{True} and \clsindmain{False}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\ifluluelse
	{\centerline {\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{BooleanHierarchy}}}
	{\centerline {\includegraphics[width=6cm]{BooleanHierarchy}}}
\caption{The Boolean Hierarchy.\label{fig:booleans}}
\end{figure}

Most of the behavior of \ct{Boolean}s can be understood by considering the method \mthind{Boolean}{ifTrue:ifFalse:}, which takes two \ct{Blocks} as arguments.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
4 factorial > 20 ifTrue: ['bigger'] ifFalse: ['smaller'] --> 'bigger'
\end{code}

The method is abstract in \ct{Boolean}.
The implementations in its concrete subclasses are both trivial:

\begin{method}{Implementations of \lct{ifTrue:ifFalse:}.}
True>>>ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock

    ^ trueAlternativeBlock value


False>>>ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock

    ^ falseAlternativeBlock value
\end{method}
\cmindex{True}{ifTrue:}
\cmindex{False}{ifTrue:}

In fact, this is the essence of OOP:
When a message is sent to an object, the object itself determines which method will be used to respond.
In this case an instance of \ct{True} simply evaluates the \emph{true} alternative, while an instance of \ct{False} evaluates the \emph{false} alternative.
All the abstract \ct{Boolean} methods are implemented in this way for \ct{True} and \ct{False}.
For example:

\begin{method}{Implementing negation.}
True>>>not
    "Negation--answer false since the receiver is true."

    ^ false
\end{method}
\cmindex{True}{not}

\ct{Booleans} offer several useful convenience methods, such as \mthind{Boolean}{ifTrue:}, \mthind{Boolean}{ifFalse:}, and \mthind{Boolean}{ifFalse:ifTrue}.
You also have a choice between eager and lazy conjunctions and disjunctions.

\begin{code}{@TEST}
(1 > 2) & (3 < 4)              --> false    "must evaluate both sides"
(1 > 2) and: [3 < 4]        --> false    "only evaluate receiver"
(1 > 2) and: [(1 / 0) > 0] --> false    "argument block is never evaluated, so no exception"
\end{code}

In the first example, both \ct{Boolean} subexpressions are evaluated, since \mthind{Boolean}{&} takes a \ct{Boolean} argument.
In the second and third examples, only the first is evaluated, since \mthind{Boolean}{and:} expects a \ct{Block} as its argument.
The \ct{Block} is evaluated only if the first argument is \pvind{true}.
While you have the choice, by default you should always use the lazy conjunction (\ct{and:}) and disjunction (\ct{or:}).

\dothis{Try to imagine how \ct{and:} as well as \ct{or:} are implemented.
    Check the implementations in \ct{Boolean}, \ct{True}, and \ct{False}.}

%=================================================================
\section{Exceptions}

\ct{Exceptions}\clsindexmain{Exception} might not be the first class you will need when starting to explore \sq.
However, \ct{Exceptions} provide a fundamental way to influence the control flow in your application, thus we already introduce them with the other basic classes.

Similar to \ct{ifTrue:} and \ct{ifFalse:}, exceptions are not part of the language, but implemented as ordinary objects in the class library.
Thus, we can work with them as we would work with any other object.

The common superclass of all exceptions is the abstract class \ct{Exception}.
There are numerous subclasses of \ct{Exception} representing specific exceptions, such as \ct{ZeroDivide}, \ct{MessageNotUnderstood}, or \ct{ProgressNotification}.
In particular, subclasses of \ct{Error} represent erroneous situations, subclasses of \ct{Notification} indicate that something interesting occurred.

To raise an exception you can use the method \mthind{Exception}{signal}.
If you want to pass a message along to help users figure out what happened, you can use \ct{Exception>>>signal:}.
When an exception is not handled by anyone, a debugger will open.

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
Error signal --> "Will open a debugger"
Error signal: 'We wanted this to happen' --> "Will open a debugger with a message"
\end{code}

As we do not want to present users with debuggers every time something unexpected happens, we can also handle exceptions directly within our code.
The methods for handling exceptions are associated with blocks, so you can find them in the \ct{exceptions} protocol of the class \ct{BlockClosure}.
To catch an exception you can use the method \ct{BlockClosure>>>on:do:}\cmindex{BlockClosure}{on:do:}\footnote{This is similar to \ct{try...catch} in other languages.}, which takes an exception class (or \ct{ExceptionSet}) as the first argument and a block as the second.

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
[(10 to: -10 by: -1) collect: [:i | 100 / i]]
   on: ZeroDivide
   do: [:ex | "do nothing"].
\end{code}

The code above does not return a collection, as the block was interrupted by the \ct{ZeroDivide} exception before it was able to return the result of the \ct{#collect:} send.

Sometimes you might not be interested in handling an exception.
Instead you might only want to ensure that some code is always executed after your block, regardless of whether an exception occurs, the block returns early, or the block finishes normally.
To achieve this, use the method \ct{BlockClosure>>>ensure:}\footnote{This is similar to \ct{finally} in other languages.} which will always execute the block passed to it.

\begin{code}{NB: CANNOT TEST}
[connectedSocket sendData: 'my network message']
   ensure: [connectedSocket close].

[(1 to: 10) pairsDo: [:number1 :number2 | | sum |
	sum := number1 + number2.
	sum isPrime ifTrue: [^ sum]]]
		ensure: [Transcript showln: 'My execution is ensured.'].
\end{code}

% - Exception sets
% - Resuming
% - Passing along state
% As we sometimes want to catch several kinds of exceptions, you can combine \ct{Exception}s into an \ct{ExceptionSet} by sending the message \ct{Exception>>>,}.

Further, \ct{Exception}s have several rich features such as resuming, restarting, or signaling other exceptions.
Browse the class \lct{Exception} to learn more.

\section{Chapter summary}

\begin{itemize}
%  \item Send \ct{yourself} to get back the receiver at the end of a cascade.

  \item If you override \ct{=} then you should override \ct{hash} as well.

  \item Override \ct{postCopy} to correctly implement copying for your objects.

  \item Send \ct{self halt} to set a breakpoint.

  \item Return \ct{self subclassResponsibility} to make a method abstract.

  \item To give an object a \ct{String} representation you should override \ct{printOn:}.

  \item Override the hook method \ct{initialize} to properly initialize instances.

  \item \ct{Number} methods automatically convert between \ct{Floats}, \ct{Fractions} and \ct{Integers}.

  \item \ct{Fractions} truly represent rational numbers rather than floats.

  \item \ct{Characters} are unique instances.

  \item \ct{Strings} are mutable; \ct{Symbols} are not.
  However, take care that string literals must not be mutated!

  \item \ct{Symbols} are unique; \ct{Strings} are not.

  \item \ct{Strings} and \ct{Symbols} are \ct{Collections} and therefore support the usual \ct{Collection} methods.
